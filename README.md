# Enigma - Non Fungible Token Lottery

## About

[Enigma](https://enigma.co/) is a secure computation protocol, where “secret nodes” perform computations over encrypted data. Enigma brings privacy to any kind of computation - not just transactions - helping to improve the adoption and usability of decentralized technologies.

This application uses enigma's secret contracts and ethereum's smart contracts to create a private [NFT](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) lottery. 

Key Features:
* client enables the contract owner to encrypt and send a list of 100 whitelisted Ethereum addresses
* client enables users to encrypt and submit their addresses to the secret contract
* winner receives his token automatically

## Using the scripts

This project comes with a few handy scripts to help you create ERC721 contracts and mint tokens.

* Create an ERC721 contract:
  `npx truffle exec ./scripts/createERC721.js <name> <symbol>`
  > will printout the address of the contract

* Mint a token
  `npx truffle exec ./scripts/mintToken.js <address> <tokenId>`

## Stack

* next-js
* react
* mobx-state-tree
* web3

## Setup

### Secret Contracts
1. `npm install`
2. rename `.env-default` to `.env`
3. modify `.env` "BUILD_CONTRACTS_PATH"
4. `discovery compile`
5. `discovery start`
6. once started: `discovery migrate`

### Client
1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. rename `.env-default` to `.env`
4. modify `.env` according to your setup
5. `npm run dev`

## Pitfalls
- After doing `discovery start` make sure you [reset](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/44311/reset-metamask-nonce) all metamask accounts.
- Cannot run discovery because docker.sock doesn't exist in windows OS.
- When using WSL, docker-compose mount paths don't work.
- Sometimes running tests fail: "incorrect epoch", fixed by delaying each test for 1 second.
- Secret contract's `Cargo.toml` must have name "contract".
